This repository contains code for analyzing viral barcode libraries. The analysis code for one-plasmid and ten-plasmid controls can be found in the `controls` directory. Code for processing plasmid, ligated, and viral libraries is located in the `stock` directory. The `urine_and_tissue` directory contains code for analyzing barcodes from mouse urine and tissue samples. Additionally, the `notebook_combined_stock_bcs.org` file is an Emacs Org Mode document that outlines the steps for extracting barcodes from sequencing libraries using `cutadapt`, clustering the barcodes with `Starcode`, etc.
